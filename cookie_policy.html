        <h1>24ground Cookie policy</h1>
        <p>A few legal notes I'm legally obligated to state: Preference cookies are processed under Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR – legitimate interest (service usability and user experience).</p>
        <p>Authentication and session cookies are processed under Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR – performance of a contract / provision of the requested service.</p>        
        <p>Therfore no consent banner is required under current usage, as no tracking or marketing cookies are used</p>
        <h2>1. What cookies are stored on your device?</h2>
        <p>The only cookies that are stored on your device are the preferences, your IFR format and (possible future implementation of) authentication</p>
        <h2>2. What are they used for?</h2>
        <p>The cookies are only used for authentication (logging you in) and preferences (your 24ground settings and IFR format) purposes. And never nothing else unless I put out a notice for everybody</p>
        <br>
        <h2>3. Who are they shared with? Who can see them?</h2>
        <p>For most of the cookies that are on your device (preference and IFR format cookies), these never leave your device. The only exception are the authentication cookies, these are only shared with the 24ground systems or somedoctorAPI (the thing powering all of my projects), in (very) rare cases, these (meaning authentication cookies) can be shared with people closely tied to ATC24 (for example moderational purposes). They are NEVER SHARED WITH THIRD PARTIES and outside of the named.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>4. Can I opt out of cookie storage?</h2>
        <p>No, not as of now (meaning to date 16.02.2026), these cookies count as "legitimate interest" and "performance of a contract / provision of the requested service" as stated before, therefore they cannot be disabled without impacting core functionality. Please note that these cookies not shared with third party companies and you can manually delete them in your browser anytime</p>
        <br>

            <p>Note: Now all this stated, please dont sue me for not going so much into the law detail</p>
            <p>Another note: Me, somedoctorCat, DRKocoruek and doktorkocourek are the same person, just different acronyms</p>
